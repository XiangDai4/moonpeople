# Moon People

A digital sanctuary for those navigating the complexities of cancer diagnoses and treatment.

## Project Overview

Moon People bridges the gap between those seeking support and those offering it, creating a warm, accessible community where no one faces cancer alone. By connecting patients with volunteers, resources, and peer support, we aim to transform the cancer journey from one of isolation to one of connection and hope.
